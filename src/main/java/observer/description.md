The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents,
called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

The observer design pattern is used in the Model-View-Controller architecture, where data model is the subject and views are observers.
