The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an
algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.
The strategy pattern:
- defines a family of algorithms,
- encapsulates each algorithm, and
- makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.
